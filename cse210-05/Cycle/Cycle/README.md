# Cycle
The best rides are the ones where you bite off much more than you can chew,
and live through it.       - Doug Bradbury -

Cycle is a game where two players can participate, the players try to cut each other off using cycles that leave a trail behind them.
The game guide and play are as follows:

1. Players can move up, down, left and right...
2. Player one moves using the W, S, A and D keys.
3. Player two moves using the I, K, J and L keys.
4. Each player's trail grows as they move.
5. Players try to maneuver so the opponent collides with their trail.
6. If a player collides with their opponent's trail...
7. A "game over" message is displayed in the middle of the screen.
8. The cycles turn white.
9. Players keep moving and turning but don't run into each other.
